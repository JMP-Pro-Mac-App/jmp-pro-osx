## What is JMP Pro?  

**JMP Pro** is a professional-grade statistical and analytical environment designed for users who demand depth, accuracy, and interactivity in their data exploration. Built with visual analytics at its core, it enables researchers, engineers, and analysts to interpret data dynamically rather than through static reports.  

Originating from SAS, JMP Pro merges advanced statistical power with an approachable interface that encourages experimentation. Users can visualize data relationships, test hypotheses, and build robust predictive models—all in real time. It’s ideal for industries such as pharmaceuticals, manufacturing, and academic research where precision and repeatability are essential.  

The application supports **multivariate statistics, machine learning algorithms, and custom scripting (JSL)** for automation. With integrated connections to **Python, R, and SQL databases**, JMP Pro ensures seamless integration within modern analytical ecosystems.  

Its interactive dashboards and advanced graphing options make it easy to communicate findings visually, while its DOE (Design of Experiments) tools allow users to optimize workflows and processes effectively.  

In essence, JMP Pro turns raw data into clear, actionable insights through its combination of scientific rigor and visual innovation.
